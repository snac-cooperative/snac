              <h3>Rationale</h3>
              <p>SNAC&apos;s research and development work is demonstrating the feasibility of separating 
                the description of people from the description of the historical records that were 
                created by them and that document their lives and work. This separation serves two 
                complementary objectives:  improving the economy and effectiveness of archival 
                description and providing researchers with a novel tool that integrates access to 
                distributed historical records and reveals the social context within which the records 
                were created.
                </p>
              <h3>Data Sources</h3>
              <p>The descriptions that constitute the bulk of the source data for the work are in three 
                forms: </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Detailed guides or finding aids that are encoded using the international standard 
                  Encoded Archival Description (EAD).</li>
                  <li>Summary descriptions of archival collections that 
                    use the library standard MARC21.</li>
                  <li>Original descriptions of people (traditionally 
                described as authority records and represented in a wide variety of non-standard 
                formats). </li>
                </ul>
              <p>Currently, SNAC is working with nearly 190,000 finding aids contributed by 
                scores of repositories, 2.2 million MARC21 descriptions contributed by OCLC WorldCat, 
                and approximately 500,000 original descriptions of people contributed by the British 
                Library, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, the Smithsonian 
                Institution Archives, and others. </p>
              <h3>Data Processing Methods</h3>
              <p>Processing of the source data takes place in three steps. </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Data is extracted 
                from the source descriptions and assembled into descriptions of individuals, families, 
                and organizations using the international standard Encoded Archival Context-Corporate 
                Bodies, Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF).</li>
                <li>The resulting EAC-CPF descriptions 
                are matched and combined with one another, and then matched against more than 25 million 
                Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) records. Data from matching VIAF records 
                supplements the data in the EAC-CPF descriptions.</li>
                <li>Finally, the resulting EAC-CPF 
                descriptions are added to the foundation of a public research tool that serves both as 
                an integrated pathway into distributed historical resources and as a biographical-historical 
                resource. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Each step in the processing is performed by one of the three SNAC collaborators. The 
                first step, extracting/assembling, is done at the Institute for Advanced Technology in 
                the Humanities, University of Virginia. The second step, matching/combining, is 
                performed at the School of Information, University of California, Berkeley. The third 
                and last step, developing the public research tool, is being carried out at the California 
                Digital Library, University of California Office of the President.
              </p>
              <p>The U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities (2010-2012) and the Andrew W. Mellon 
                Foundation (2012-2015) have funded the R&amp;D. The web site for the first phase of the 
                R&amp;D phase is maintained <a href="http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/SNACI/">here</a>.
