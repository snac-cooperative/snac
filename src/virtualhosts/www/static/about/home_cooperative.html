              <p>The SNAC Cooperative Program (SNAC-C) has archive, library, and museum members. The long-term 
                objective of the Cooperative is an ever-expanding international membership that will together 
                build an ever-expanding corpus of reliable descriptions of people linked to and providing contextual 
                understanding of the historical records that are the primary evidence for understanding their lives 
                and work.</p>
              <p>The Cooperative will serve both the member institutions, and researchers, teachers, and others that 
                are interested in persons, organizations, and families and the historical records that document their 
                lives and work.</p> 
              <p>The Cooperative will serve the members institutions in two important ways. First, sharing the 
                descriptions of the people that created and are documented in historical documents will lead 
                to processing efficiencies. When a person, organization, or family is documented by one member 
                institution, it is available for use by all of the other members. Rather than duplicating 
                descriptions within each institution's descriptive system, one well-curated description will be 
                available to all. Second, the links out to holdings in many institutions and the historical 
                social network links within enables unified access to distributed holdings, and provides both 
                documentary and social context for understanding the holdings. Through sharing descriptions, 
                the Cooperative will enable archives, libraries, and museums to realize complementary economic 
                benefits, eliminating duplicative work and producing more effective description.</p> 
              <p>The Cooperative will serve researchers, teachers, and others in two ways. First, it will 
                significantly ameliorate the challenge of discovering and locating the resources that document 
                our shared history. Painstakingly piecing together these networks constitutes an essential and 
                time-consuming historical research activity. SNAC also makes explicit what has been, 
                at best, implicit in archival description: the social-professional-intellectual networks within 
                which the lives and work of the people documented in historical resources took place. SNAC, in 
                essence, reveals a global social-document network that connects the past to the present.</p>

              <p>The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration serves as the Cooperative Secretariat, 
                and the University of Virginia, in collaboration with the California Digital Library, hosts the 
                technological platform. </p>
              <p>The current two-year pilot phase (2015-2017) of the SNAC Cooperative formally began August 1, 2015. 
                It is generously funded by a $1 million grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to the 
                University of Virginia.</p>
              <p>The pilot phase of the Cooperative has both social and technological objectives. The social 
                objectives include developing the Secretariat administrative structure, and developing a 
                community-based governance structure. The primary technological objective will be transforming 
                the SNAC R&amp;D platform into a platform that will support ongoing cooperative maintenance of 
                the SNAC description and access data.</p>

              <!--<p class="small_header">From R&amp;D to a Cooperative Program for Archival Description</p>
              <p style="margin-top:-10px">The planning process is laying the groundwork for transforming the data 
              and technical infrastructure developed in the R&amp;D activities into a sustainable 
              international cooperative hosted by the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. 
              The Cooperative will enable archivists, librarians, and scholars to maintain the 
              descriptive data and to extend the scope of the people and records included. It will 
              improve the economy and quality of archival processing and description, as well as 
              address the longstanding research challenge of discovering, locating, and using distributed 
              historical records.</p>
              
              <p class="small_header">Background</p>
              <p style="margin-top:-10px">The early results of the R&amp;D work led the SNAC team to realize that its methods would 
              effectively support the extraction of the biographical-historical data embedded in the 
              archival resource descriptions and the assembling of the data into descriptions of 
              individual, families, and organizations. These descriptions would provide the foundation 
              for a novel research tool. But, while the methods could continue to be refined and 
              enhanced, algorithms alone are not sufficient to build a sustainable, dynamic body of 
              data that can serve the processing needs of the professional archive and manuscript 
              library community and support a reliable research tool for vast communities of scholars, 
              students, and the public at large that are interested in the study of  
              history. </p>
              
              <p>In the fall of 2011, with funding from the U.S. Institute for Museum and Library Services, 
              SNAC began to begin to build support from archivists, librarians, and scholars for 
              transforming its R&amp;D into an international cooperative program that would both support the 
              work of these communities and provide an important service that would facilitate historical 
              research and understanding. Support for the idea began to grow through a series of meetings 
              beginning in the spring of 2012, and the rough outlines of the cooperative began to emerge. 
              In February 2013, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration committed to 
              becoming the administrative host of the cooperative, and immediately became a collaborator 
              in the planning process.</p>
              <p>The web site for the first phase of the Cooperative phase is maintained <a href="http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/SNACI/NAAC_index.html">here</a>.</p>
              
              <p class="small_header">Current Activities</p>
              <p style="margin-top:-10px">In order to further the planning, in the fall of 2013 the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation invited 
              a proposal for a one-year planning process to study in detail the administrative, governance, 
              and technological requirements of the program. This current phase is focusing on: </p>
              
              <ul><li>Performing user requirement studies and developing detailed technical infrastructure planning.</li>
                <li>Establishing the initial administrative and governance structure. </li>
                <li>Determining requirements and developing models for sustainability.</li>
                <li>Establishing a legal foundation and intellectual property policies.</li>
                <li>Recruiting initial members.</li> </ul>
              
              <p>The next stage is a two-year pilot implementation of the cooperative, commencing in the spring of 2015.</p>-->
