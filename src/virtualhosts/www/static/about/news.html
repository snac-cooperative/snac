              <h2>August 2015</h2>
              <p><span style="font-style:italic">Social Networks and Archival Context Cooperative Program Launches</span></p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.archives.gov/">U.S. 
                National Archives and Records Administration<img class="hyp" src="images/hyperlink.png"/></a> (NARA), the University of Virginia, 
                and the California Digital Library are pleased to announce the launching of the Social 
                Networks and Archival Context (SNAC) Cooperative Program. The two-year pilot phase of the 
                Cooperative is generously funded by a $1 million grant from <a href="http://www.mellon.org/">The Andrew W. Mellon 
                  Foundation<img class="hyp" src="images/hyperlink.png"/></a> 
                to the University of Virginia.</p>          
              <p>NARA will serve as the secretariat of the Cooperative, and the 
                <a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu">Institute for Advanced 
                  Technology in the Humanities<img class="hyp" src="images/hyperlink.png"/></a> at 
                the University of Virginia, in collaboration with the 
                <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/">California Digital Library<img class="hyp" src="images/hyperlink.png"/></a>, will host the technical platform.</p>          
              <p><span style="font-style:italic">Inaugural Members</span></p>          
              <p>While the Cooperative is ultimately intended to be international, the inaugural pilot 
                members are drawn from a cross-section of U.S. archives, libraries, and museums.</p>

              <p><span style="font-style:italic">Objectives</span></p>          
              <p>The pilot phase of the Cooperative will have both social and technological objectives. 
                The social objectives include developing the secretariat administrative structure, and 
                developing a community-based governance structure. The primary technological objective 
                will be transforming the SNAC R&amp;D platform into a platform that will support ongoing 
                cooperative maintenance of the SNAC description and access data. Inaugural members will 
                be key partners in developing the governance structure, and both the maintenance and public 
                facets of the technological platform. While new members will not be added during the 
                two-year pilot implementation, the Cooperative will welcome expressions of interest in 
                future membership.</p>          
              <p><span style="font-style:italic">About SNAC</span></p>          
              <p>SNAC began as an R&amp;D project in 2010 with a grant from the 
                <a href="http://www.neh.gov/">National 
                  Endowment for the Humanities<img class="hyp" src="images/hyperlink.png"/></a>. 
                The project has demonstrated the feasibility of 
                separating the description of persons, families, and organizations&mdash;including their 
                socio-historical contexts&mdash;from the description of the historical resources that are 
                the primary evidence of their lives and work. SNAC has also demonstrated that the 
                biographical-historical data extracted and assembled can be used to provide researchers 
                with convenient, integrated access to historical collections held by archives and 
                libraries, large and small, around the world.</p>          
              <p>Initial work made it clear that the potential power of the assembled data to transform 
                research and improve the economy and effectiveness of archival descriptive practices 
                required more than digital tools. With funding from the <a href="http://www.imls.gov/">Institute 
                  for Museum and Library Services<img class="hyp" src="images/hyperlink.png"/></a> and 
                the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the SNAC team performed detailed 
                planning on how best to transform the R&amp;D into a sustainable international cooperative 
                that would enable archivists, librarians, and scholars to maintain the descriptive data 
                and to extend the scope of the people and records included. The SNAC Cooperative aspires 
                to improve the economy and quality of archival processing and description, and at the 
                same time, to address the longstanding research challenge of discovering, locating, 
                and using distributed historical records.</p>          
              <p>SNAC is the <a href="http://archivists.org/node/19809">recipient<img 
                class="hyp" src="images/hyperlink.png"/></a> of the 2015 Society of American 
                Archivists C.F.W. Coker Award. 
                One supporter wrote that SNAC &ldquo;will fundamentally begin to change the landscape of 
                archival description: the program will be a substantive contribution to the national, 
                and indeed, international platform, making the description of archives more efficient 
                and effective, and significantly ameliorating the challenge of discovering, locating, 
                and understanding the resources that document our shared history.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, 
                the California Digital Library, and the School for Information Science at the 
                University of California, Berkeley collaborated on the SNAC R&amp;D (2010-2015). 
                The same organizations and the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration 
                collaborated on planning the SNAC Cooperative (2012-2015). During the planning 
                process, archivists, librarians, researchers, scholars, and funders were consulted 
                and provided invaluable assistance.</p>          
              
              <h2>August 2014</h2>
              <p>Social Networks and Archival Context (SNAC) is pleased to announce two major developments: the 
                release of a redesigned web site and Prototype Historical Research Tool and a generous grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>
              
              <p><span style="font-style:italic">Redesigned Website and Prototype Historical Research Tool</span></p>
              <p>SNAC has substantially revised and improved the SNAC web site and the <a 
                href="http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/snac/search">Prototype History Research Tool</a>. The prototype 
              is an aggregate of biographical information about people, both individuals and groups, who created or are documented in 
              historical resources. Users can explore the lives of individual people, organizations, and families; browse featured 
              descriptions; and discover and locate connected historical resources that document these lives. </p>
              <p>This release of the prototype draws on more than 2.6 million (soon to grow to more than 3.5 million) descriptions of 
                persons, organizations, and families. These descriptions were derived from 2.2 million WorldCat archival descriptions 
                and nearly 300,000 British Library authority records.  Forthcoming releases will include descriptions derived from nearly 
                190,000 detailed descriptions of historical collections provided by a wide range of government and academic archives and 
                libraries. </p>
              <p>The persons, organizations, and families represented include the familiar (<a 
                href="http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6w9576g">Thomas Jefferson</a> and <a

                inspiring (<a href="http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w64q82r1">Elizabeth Blackwell</a>, <a 
                  href="http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6t43tq4">Florence Kelley</a>, and <a 
                    href="http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6st7wtd">Eddie Mabo</a>), and the perhaps less known (the

              <p><span style="font-style:italic">Cooperative Program Planning</span></p>
              <p>The SNAC team is also delighted to receive additional funding from the <a href="http://www.mellon.org/">Mellon 
                Foundation<img class="hyp" src="images/hyperlink.png"/></a> to support the final planning 
                for an international archive description and access cooperative, to be hosted by the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/">U.S. 
                  National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)<img class="hyp" src="images/hyperlink.png"/></a>. The Cooperative 
                will enable archivists, librarians, and scholars to maintain the descriptive data 
                and to extend the scope of the people and records included. It will improve the economy and quality of archival processing 
                and description, and will address the longstanding research challenge of discovering, locating, and using distributed 
                historical records. The current work will establish the legal, administrative, and technical structure of the Cooperative, 
                in preparation for a pilot implementation in 2015.</p>
