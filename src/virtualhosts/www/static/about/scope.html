              <p>As of July 2015, the Prototype History Research tool contains over 3.7 million 
                descriptions of persons, families, and organizations (identity descriptions) derived 
                from more than 6.6 million EAC-CPF records derived primarily from archival resource 
                descriptions and original authority records. The source data was provided by a large 
                number of <a href="datacontrib.html">contributors</a>. The SNAC identities are linked to 
                holdings in more than 4000 repositories. &ldquo;Featured records&rdquo; provides random selections of 
                identities that also match entries in Wikipedia, and these are typically for well-known 
                (or at least relatively well-known) persons. These persons also tend to be well-documented 
                in the primary resources and thus constitute &ldquo;strong&rdquo; identities. However, many of the persons, 
                organizations, and families in the Prototype History Research tool are weakly identified, 
                which is to say, the available evidence does not establish a strong, reliable identity. </p>
              <p>The linked resource descriptions represent all resources that are identifiably related to 
                the identity, either as a creator or a subject of the resource. Holdings of hundreds of 
                repositories, large and small, are represented in these resource links. While the representation 
                of holding repositories and known, available resources is substantial, researchers should not 
                assume that the links represent all available resources. As additional repositories contribute 
                data to SNAC, the number of linked descriptions of holdings will continue to grow. There are 
                always new discoveries to be made, as the vast majority of resource descriptions mention only 
                a fraction of the persons, organizations, and families represented in a collection, and not all 
                collections in any given repository have been processed and described. </p>
              
              <!--p>As of July 2014, the Prototype History Research Tool contains over 2.6 million descriptions 
                of persons, families, and organizations (identity descriptions) derived from 2.2 
                million OCLC WorldCat archival resource descriptions and nearly 300,000 identity descriptions 
                from the British Library. The identities are linked to holdings in more than 2000 repositories.
                The &ldquo;featured records&rdquo; offer selections from identities that also match entries in Wikipedia, 
                and these are typically for well-known (or at least relatively well-known) persons. These persons 
                also tend to be well-documented in the primary resources and thus constitute &ldquo;strong&rdquo; identities. 
                However, many of the persons, organizations, and families are weakly identified, which is to say, 
                the available evidence does not establish a strong, reliable identity.</p>
              
              <p>The linked resource descriptions represent all resources that are identifiably 
                related to the identity, either as a creator or a subject of resource. The holdings 
                of hundreds of repositories, large and small, are represented in these resource links. 
                While the representation of holding repositories and known, available resources is 
                substantial, researchers should not assume that the links represent all available 
                resources. As additional repositories contribute data to SNAC, the number of resource 
                links will continue to grow. There are always new discoveries to be made, as the vast 
                majority of resource descriptions mention only a fraction of the persons, organizations, 
                and families represented in a collection.</p>
              <p>In the nine months following the July release, more than one million additional 
                descriptions will be gradually added. These additional descriptions will be derived 
                primarily from the following sources:<p>
                <ul><li>Smithsonian Institution Archives expeditions</li>
                  <li>Smithsonian Institution Archives Joseph Henry correspondents</li>
                  <li>Smithsonian Institution Archives organization descriptions</li>
                  <li>New York State Archives agency descriptions</li>
                  <li>National Archives and Records Administration identity descriptions</li>
                  <li>Approximately 190,000 detailed guides (finding aids) contributed by thirteen 
                    archival access consortia and 43 archives and libraries.</li>
